# CLI D&amp;D
Another dumb project of mine, I'm using this to test my code-writing abilities and create a game (partly) from scratch.
I'm hoping this can be a full command line D&D game you can play on your own. I'll probably end up writing a GUI version in Pygame or Ursina too.

## Roadmap (kind of)
This will start by using the campaign &quot;Lost Mine of Phandelver&quot; and eventually transition into using a bunch of different campaigns that the player can pick from at the start.

I'll start by getting the game to work, and later add a way to remember the player's progress after exiting the program.

The end goal is to have the program act as the DM and other players to create a single-player D&amp;D game that is still fun and immersive.

## How it'll work
The player will start the program for the first time and be asked to create a character or pick from some pre-made characters (based on some of D&amp;D's presets).

After choosing/creating a character, the player will be asked to choose a campaign to play. At first, it will only include the above mentioned campaign, but more will be added later on.

If it isn't their first time playing, the game will go straight to the campaign picker. If the player has played a given campaign before, it will be initialized with the character they've played with previously. Otherwise, they'll be asked to choose/create a new character.
